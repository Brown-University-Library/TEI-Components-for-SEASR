  <correction status='medium' method='markup'>
    <p>The text has received two forms of correction. The first is
    correction of printers errors occurring within the original
    document. This is done both during initial transcription and
    during subsequent proofreading. Correction of simple typographical
    errors is done using <gi>sic</gi> elements, with the corrected
    reading recorded as the content of its sibling <gi>corr</gi>
    element. Broken type is not recorded. Words accidentally omitted
    by the printer have not been supplied. Portions of text which are
    difficult or impossible to read are marked using <gi>damage</gi>
    (where the photocopy or the original text is damaged or torn),
    <gi>unclear</gi> (where the photocopy or the original text is
    illegible), <gi>gap</gi>, and <gi>supplied</gi>. Repeated words
    are marked with <gi>sic</gi>. Manuscript additions and corrections
    to the text are transcribed using the <gi>add</gi> element.</p>
    <p>The second form of correction is intended to ensure the
    accuracy of the transcription, and is done by proofreading and
    correction subsequent to transcription.</p>
  </correction>
  <normalization source='WWP' method='markup'>
    <p>The use of both upper- and lower-case i, j, u, v, and vv has
    been normalized to modern 20th century typographical practices
    using a stand-in for the TEI <gi>choice</gi> element:
    <gi>vuji</gi>. See <ref
    target="../schema/wwp-store.doc.html#vuji">its documentation</ref>
    for a table of equivalents in TEI.</p>
    <p>In addition, regularized values for dates encoded with the
    <gi>date</gi> element have been encoded using the <att>when</att>
    attribute, in the format used by the TEI data.temporal datatype
    (e.g. 'yyyy-mm-dd').</p>
    <p>All punctuational dashes longer than an em-dash have been
    regularized to an em-dash. Groups of hyphens or dashes which
    function punctuationally like an em-dash have been recorded as a
    sequence of two HORIZONTAL BAR characters (U+2015).</p>
    <p>Spacing between words and following punctuation has been
    regularized to zero spaces; spacing between words has been
    regularized to one space.</p>
  </normalization>
  <quotation marks='all' form='rend'>
    <p>All quotation marks have been encoded using the <att>rend</att>
    attribute of the element they offset. Marks are recorded
    faithfully as either single or double, left or right, regardless
    of whether or not they mirror modern conventions.</p>
    <p>Apostrophes have been retained as text content using APOSTROPHE
    character (U+0027), and thus are distinguished from quotation
    marks.</p>
  </quotation>
  <hyphenation eol='all'>
    <p>The encoding distinguishes between hard and soft hyphens. Hard
    hyphens, whether at the end-of-line or not, are recorded as a
    plain-text hyphen character. Soft hyphens are recorded using the
    SOFT HYPHEN character (U+00AD). Hyphens in catchwords are
    transcribed as hard hyphens.</p>
  </hyphenation>
  <p>This is a documentary transcription of the source document. No
  variants from other copies or editions have been included. Source
  lineation has been retained.</p>

  methodology, please see the WWP's documentation page at
