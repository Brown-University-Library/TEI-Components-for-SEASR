<samplingDecl xmlns="http://www.wwp.brown.edu/ns/textbase/storage/1.0">
  <p>Texts in this collection are written in English by women, or
  translated into English by women, and were published before 1850.
  They are transcribed in their entirety, including front and back
  matter, except where a text by a woman is published as part of a
  longer text mostly by a male author. In such cases, the portion by
  the female author may be excerpted from the whole. Any omissions
  from the transcription are encoded with <gi>gap</gi>.</p>
