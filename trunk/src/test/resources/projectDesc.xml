  <p>The Women Writers Project at Brown University is an academic
  project devoted to research on women's writing and text encoding.
  The project's primary work is the creation of a full-text database
  of pre-Victorian women's writing in English, encoded in XML using
  the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative. In addition, the WWP
  publishes research on text encoding, and supports research and
  teaching on women's writing.</p>
