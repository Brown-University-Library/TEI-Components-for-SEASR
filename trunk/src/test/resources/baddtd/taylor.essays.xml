              <p>We have been rather undecided whether we should notice this
<lb/>pleasing little book under the class of <emph>Novels</emph>, or under that which
<lb/>is headed <emph>Religious</emph>. In the one case, we should have praised it
<lb/>as replete with wholesome advice and the most rational induce­
<lb/>ments to piety—in the other, it wins our approbation by the sim­
<lb/>plicity and interest of the tale, the truth with which the characters
<lb/>are drawn, the natural liveliness of its scenes, and the excellence
<lb/>of its moral. The worldly reader will be forced to acknowledge
<lb/>the verisimilitude of many of the feelings exhibited in <persName>Elizabeth</persName>
<lb/>the heroine, the cure of whose propensity to <emph>display</emph> is the subject
<lb/>of the tale; and older readers must feel a paternal love for Emily,
<lb/>who forms the contrast to her friend's character.</p>

The subjects of these Essays are well chosen, and ingeniously
<lb/>diversified; and the fair writer displays a degree of piety, with a
<lb/>knowledge and application of the Scriptures, which increases the
<lb/>value of her work.—</p>

The little book before us is entitled <title rend="case(smallcaps)pre(‘)post(’)">Maternal Solici­
<lb/>tude <hi rend="slant(upright)">for a</hi> Daughter's best Interests;</title> and every page of
<lb/>it breathes the most earnest and anxious concern for the spiritual
<lb/>peace and the eternal salvation of her to whom its precepts, its
<lb/>warnings, and its admonitions are addressed. Much of the value
<lb/>of this work consists in its being truly what it assumes to be; hence
<lb/>there is a fervour, a spirit, and a tenderness in its instructions, that
<lb/>could never be affected: a mother's pulse beats in every line, and
<lb/>the warmth of a mother's heart gives vitality to the whole.</p>

              <p>The duties of a wife, a mother, and a mistress of a family, are
<lb/>admirably pourtrayed and most successfully urged in this little
<lb/>volume. It is a book that will be placed in the hands of those who
<lb/>are to fill those enviable situations, with the utmost advantage.
<lb/>The short religious portion at the conclusion is warm, affectionate,
<lb/>and just, but not tinged with the slightest spirit of fanaticism.</p>

              <p>This book forms a very useful manual of duties which are cer­
<lb/>tainly of the first importance, and deserves a place in the library
<lb/>of every female in the class and situation for which it is meant.
<lb/>The style is well adapted to the subject, clear and accurate, without
<lb/>any attempt at fine writing, and free from the monotonous heaviness
<lb/>so often attributed to didactic compositions, partly, perhaps, be­
<lb/>cause we do not love to be taught. A glow of genuine feeling gives
<lb/>a sustained interest to it; but its best praise is, that the principles
<lb/>it keeps in view are those of truth and holiness as revealed to us
<lb/>in the word of God.—</p>
